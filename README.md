## What is a Raspberry pi pico? 
The files in this repository are for simple projects for the Raspberry Pi Pico. A cheaper and smaller version of the Raspberry PI. It is a good alternative for the tradional Raspberry Pi to learn python, hardware/software interaction, and simple electronics. The PICO version is still very versatile and can be used to make many sorrs of prjects!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to do these projects, make sure you have:
- Pico Display unit
- Raspberry Pi usb cable(most likely comes with it when you buy the PICO), 
- a micropython intrepter
- electronic componenets (wires, diodes, and a breadboard(isn't necessary but will be useful)).

### Installation

Thonny is a useful and simple python intrepter useful for programming PICOs. It is also reccommended by the developers themselves. 

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/2 - The offical guide explains the steps straightforwardly.

In summary:

- Install thonny on your operating system, the website has the appropriate inscrutionss given the OS.
- Launch the IDE and find and hold the boostel button on your PICO - the tiny button. Then plug in your PICO to your computer.
- On the bottom right corner of the IDE window it should show your python version. Click it and it should show "MicroPython (Raspberry PICO)".
- Click on it and it should ask to install the firmware. Onec done, you can start programming the PICO!

## Understanding

This showcases the layout of the PICO. Each of the numbers are different pins,and the words next to them are the their usage. There are many different functionalities on the PICO, showing how versatile it is!

### Basic features

- GPIO
This stands for General purpose Input and Output and are pins that allow the Raspberry PI to interact with the phyiscal world. This allows it to send signals to other electronic conponents. 
When programming the PICO, the intepreter allocates each pin to a number. For example, GP0 is the first pin.
